							<u>SCP-106</u>
						</h2>
							<blockquote cite="http://www.scp-wiki.net/security-clearance-levels">
								"SCP-106 appears to be an elderly humanoid, with a general appearance of advanced decomposition. This appearance may vary, but the “rotting” quality is observed in all forms. SCP-106 is not exceptionally agile, and will remain motionless for days at a time, waiting for prey. SCP-106 is also capable of scaling any vertical surface and can remain suspended upside down indefinitely. When attacking, SCP-106 will attempt to incapacitate prey by damaging major organs, muscle groups, or tendons, then pull disabled prey into its pocket dimension. SCP-106 appears to prefer human prey items in the 10-25 years of age bracket."
							</blockquote>
							<p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									SCP-106 has a unique attack where he is able to teleport a target into his pocket dimension. In order to catch targeted-players, they need to be in a blank-point range. As SCP-106, there is a 1-second cooldown in between each attack.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									When a player is caught by SCP-106, the player is welcomed by ten hallways. By walking into the hallway, they have the possibility to escape. Eight of those hallways will kill the person by default. A server could change the number and they could make the exit change each time someone escapes. They can also change the destination of the exit, but by default the exit always teleports the player outside of SCP-106’s containment chamber. When in SCP-106 ‘s pocket dimension, the player will take damage slowly to the point of their death. If the alpha warhead was detonated, instead of his standard attack, his attack would one-shot the target. His attack would be similar to SCP-049’s attack (without the range though).
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									SCP-106 has the least amount of health(around 650hp), but the damage from the bullets are 2 points of health per bullet, which makes him very resistance against bullets. A server can also change the amount of health he has. The only sources of damage that are unaffected from his resistances are the MicroHD, tesla gates, alpha warhead and Frag Grenades.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									SCP-106 has two unique abilities. One is to teleport to various locations from a portal. Pressing the tab key on your keyboard would display two options. The option on the left is to create a portal where he is standing, while the other one is to teleport to the portal that he is able to place, or has placed beforehand. While teleporting, there is an interval lasting a couple of seconds, where SCP-106 dissolves into the floor and pops back up from the portal he could have placed.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									SCP-106’s second ability allows him to walk through any door. SCP-106 can bypass any door that a normal SCP would not be able to go through. The exception to this, are the doors that are actually props in the facility.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									To counteract these abilities, he has very loud footsteps. The player is able to detect the footsteps. Also, he shares the same walking speed with the d-class, or scientist.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									To re-contain SCP-106, you would need to go to SCP-106 containment, which is located in the heavy containment zone. To open the door to SCP-106 containment chamber, you would need a card. The cards that are able to open the door are the Containment Engineer, Facility Manager, and the O5 Command card(Sometimes a server can change what cards can open up the door). Once opening the door, one player would be required to enter a small alcove in the control area, however will soon after die. Another player is then required to press a button on the opposite wall. After ten to fifteen seconds of screaming broadcast over the entire facility, SCP-106 would be contained.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><u>Playing as SCP-106</u></h3>
									When you first spawn as SCP-106, you want to place a portal near your containment. After that, go for the guards that spawn in the entrance zone. You are resistant to their bullets unlike other SCPs, so they would be your best targets. If you happen to stumble across the entrance zone first, wait for them. It is best for you to ambush them because they would be a point-blank range. After, head towards the elevator and then towards SCP-914.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									If you come across an elevator in the first few minutes, it is fine for you to use the elevator go down. Go catch some d-classes or scientists and make your way to SCP-914. After you find SCP-914, go though the blast doors and catch as much people you like. It’s recommended to only catch five, as it will be explained later on why. If you are alone, wait for your other SCPs to arrive, just in case someone opens the blast door and tries to escape. 
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									Try not to catch people with cards that can open up your containment. On the occasion that you might have, use the portal that you have placed previously and check to see if anyone has escaped from the pocket dimension. If they did, you can catch them once more. However, if one of them has a card to open the door, it will be dangerous because they might have the possibility to re-contain you. That is why it is recommended to catch only five people. It is the number of people that is manageable and there is not a chance to have the possibility of letting a large group of people into the heavy containment zone. 
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									If they escape from the pocket dimension and did not have the card to open the door, they would usually leave the door of your containment open, which is an indicator that someone escaped into heavy. After that, NTF or Chaos will spawn. The number of people to catch is the same, and since they do not have a keycard to open your chamber, you can be lenient. 
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									If NTF or Chaos is getting ready to detonate the Alpha warhead, you should tell your fellow SCPs to head toward the surface zone. To prepare for the warhead, you want to place the portal on the surface and reset the warhead in the heavy, then teleport to the portal. After the warhead is detonated, your attack is a one-shot kill to any target, so it is safe to chase people down. Since SCP-106 is slow and very noticeable, team up with other SCPs to be safe.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><u>Escaping From SCP-106</u></h3>
									When escaping from SCP-106, the only options are to run and close the doors that you pass through. SCP-106 is slow and can be killed easily if  frags or the MicroHD are available. SCP-106’s walking speed is slow, and as stated before, shares the same walking speed with the player, so it is very easy to outrun him. Try not to get cornered, as that would decrease your chance of running away. When using MicroHD, try to catch him off guard. If he tries to run, pursue him, since now your walking speed is greater than his. He has the ability to run away, but it takes couple seconds to dissolve into the floor and he is vulnerable in that state. Frags are one-shot and can kill him, even if he has high health. If it did not, his health should be very low. If you are caught by him, then it is luck you depend on when deciding which hallway would be the exit.

						<div id="AboutSiteContent">
							<p>
								Basic information about each class and scp, but included tricks or strategies that you can implement to the game. 
								Just wanted to give information to get those pestering D-Class or to escape from a SCP. This website is not asking for you to go try-hard in the game, it is just a gather of my experiences in the game. 
								The information that you would find would be ways to get to places that you normally would not be able to or situations that can happen to you. 
								The information that you would see is Megapatch 1 or Changelog 8.0.0 of the game.
