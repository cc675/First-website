							<u>SCP-096</u>
						</h2>
							<blockquote cite="http://www.scp-wiki.net/security-clearance-levels">
								“SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height. Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild malnutrition. Arms are grossly out of proportion with the rest of the subject's body, with an approximate length of 1.5 meters each. Skin is mostly devoid of pigmentation, with no sign of any body hair.
								SCP-096's jaw can open to four (4) times the norm of an average human. Other facial features remain similar to an average human, with the exception of the eyes, which are also devoid of pigmentation.”

									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									SCP-096 works very similar in the lore and the game SCP: Containment Breach. His deal is that he cannot be looked at, and when someone look at him, he gets into an agitated state for 5 seconds. Soon after, he goes into a full rage state. Once he is in his rage state, his speed is twice as fast as the running player and can one-shot any target. He can also break small doors in his rage state. Doors that cannot break are blast doors, the Alpha warhead control panel door on the surface, and checkpoint doors. After his rage state, there is a 10 second-cooldown that occurs, in which in that period of time it is safe to look at him. During that time, SCP-096 cannot go into his rage state, which makes him especially vulnerable. His hop is the shortest where players can easily take advantage of.  
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<h3><u>Playing as SCP-096</u></h3>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									When playing SCP-096, the first spawn will be outside of your containment. It is recommended to head towards the light containment zone to meet up with SCP-173. If you do not have a SCP-173, then head towards SCP-914 and roam around the area for people. You do not need to go to SCP-914 at the start and stay put. You are there to help your fellow SCPs secure kills and break down doors.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									In the heavy containment zone, be careful for tesla gates. If the server experiences lag, you could lag into the tesla gate, killing you in the process. Your speed is very slow, so your actions need to be worth it. If you have a SCP-173, use each other to your advantage, since SCP-173 needs to be looked at.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									Notable things to take in:
									<ul>
										<li>At the end of your rage state, you should head towards an area where you are the safest and wait for the cooldown to finish. </li>
										<li>When you are in a cooldown, you are at the most vulnerable position to be in.</li>
										<li>When someone has a MicroHD, be very careful. If someone has experience with the weapon, you can easily die to it.</li>
										<li>To kill people situated in high places in entrance zone, stand right at the top of the stairs and jump on the rails. Then jump to the other rails.</li>
										<li>To kill people situated at the end of the walkway near Gate A, go on the step at the end of the other side and use it as a launch platform to jump to the rails. Use that to get to the other side.</li>
										<li>In the intercom room in the entrance zone, there is a possibility for SCP-096 to be triggered through the door because of his head model that sticks out. </li>
									</ul>
									<h3><u>Escaping from SCP-096</u></h3>
									When escaping from SCP-096, your best bet is to look away from hi. The best way to do that is to look up at the ceiling and not look down too often. Looking down has the possibility to trigger SCP-096 because you may see his limbs or feet. After avoiding SCP-096, closing the door behind you is an option, since SCP-096 is slow. Try not to go through a door that is blocked by SCP-096. His model can cause some lag because of the player models colliding, which can also trigger hin too. Using a MicroHD is the best way to dispose of SCP-096 quickly. The best time is after his cooldown and during the 5 seconds agitated state. If you are aiming for the 5 seconds agitated state, start up the MicroHD first and then trigger SCP-096.

						<div id="AboutSiteContent">
							<p>
								Basic information about each class and scp, but included tricks or strategies that you can implement to the game. 
								Just wanted to give information to get those pestering D-Class or to escape from a SCP. This website is not asking for you to go try-hard in the game, it is just a gather of my experiences in the game. 
								The information that you would find would be ways to get to places that you normally would not be able to or situations that can happen to you. 
								The information that you would see is Megapatch 1 or Changelog 8.0.0 of the game.
