								“Researchers are the scientific branch of the Foundation, drawn from the ranks of the smartest and best-trained research scientists from around the world. With specialists in every field imaginable, from chemistry and botany to more esoteric or specialized fields such as theoretical physics and xenobiology, the goal of the Foundation's research projects is to gain a better understanding of unexplained anomalies and how they operate.”

									Scientists spawn on a one-two ratio of d-class. So you would need two d-class for one scientist to spawn. Scientist always spawn in These rooms:
										<ul>
											<li>GR18 room</li>
											<li>##00 room</li>
											<li>GR18 room</li>
											<li>EXIT-A</li>
											<li>GR18 room</li>
											<li>EXIT-B</li>
											<li>WC00 room</li>
										</ul>
											They spawn with a Scientist keycard and a medkit.

									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<h3><u>Playing As Scientist</u></h3>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									As a Scientist, you want to escape the facility, so the natural thing to do is find SCP-914, upgrade the keycard and escape. If you see a D-class with a gun, 9 out 10 times, he would kill you. There are numerous places where you can find a key-card.

									<ul>
										<li>PC15 room</li>
										<li>GR18 room</li>
										<li>#012 room</li>
										<li>WC00 room</li>
									</ul>
									For the #012 room you can open it.
									<ul>
										<li>#012 room</li>
										<li>GR18 room</li>
										<li>WC00 room</li>
										<li>PT00 room</li>
										<li>##00 room</li>
									</ul>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									In PT00 the room at the top of the stairs is the pistol spawn
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									When you reach SCP-914, you will need a key card to open it. After opening the blast doors, the the machine would be on 1 to 1. The fastest way to upgrade the Scientist card is to turn it into a Zone Manager by using the machine into 1 to 1. Then upgrade the card to 05 Command card by setting it as Fine. If you have a pistol you can also upgrade it using Fine. If you are determined and lucky you can turn it into a MicroHD weapon and kill SCPs. It is a suggestion to kill all of the D-class so they will not betray you afterwards. Be careful though, going in the machine as rough or coarse would either kill you or do damage depending on the server.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									Some servers require you to drop your items to upgrade them, while some do not. Be careful of people stealing your key cards or weapons, if the server require you to drop them. This is one of the choke-points where the SCPs can trap and kill you, so you want to upgrade it fast and immediately leave SCP-914. If there is only one SCP, you have a better chance to escape from SCP-914, but means you would have a harder time in heavy containment zone. Another thing is to work together with guards of the facility, if they manage to reach light containment zone.
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									Perhaps you are late to SCP-914 and already see SCPs hogging the exit, you wait until NTF or Chaos Insurgency spawns. The SCPs would naturally go to entrance zone to battle out the NTF or Chaos. That is your chance upgrade your card
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									Another situation is when a SCP goes through a checkpoint door. You can run through the door at the last moments just before the checkpoints door is about to close. Another way to heavy is when you are caught by SCP-106 and escape from his pocket dimension.
									When you are in entrance zone and Chaos just spawn, your best bet is to hide and wait for the majority of them to head towards heavy, then go towards the gates to surface zone.

							About this Site
						</h2
						<div id="AboutSiteContent">
							<p>
								Basic information about each class and scp, but included tricks or strategies that you can implement to the game. 
								Just wanted to give information to get those pestering D-Class or to escape from a SCP. This website is not asking for you to go try-hard in the game, it is just a gather of my experiences in the game. 
								The information that you would find would be ways to get to places that you normally would not be able to or situations that can happen to you. 
								The information that you would see is Megapatch 1 or Changelog 8.0.0 of the game.
